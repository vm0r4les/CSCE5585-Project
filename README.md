# CSCE5585-Project
Network Design and Implementation Project
Trust Evaluation Project
The continuous evolution and development of communications and information technology and the constant use of the Internet have been expanding the adoption of cloud computing, encouraging organizations to migrate their data, applications, and infrastructure into a cloud environment. Organizations from different industries have been migrating large amounts of data to the cloud; however, some of the services provided by cloud providers pose serious accessibility, integrity, and privacy risks to sensitive information. 
This proposal aims to mitigate the threats to improve security in the cloud, focusing on the trust evaluation of virtual machines in an IaaS cloud environment and ensuring secure access to resources that provide the required IT infrastructure, such as virtual machines, networking, storage, processing, and other critical computing resources. In addition, the increasing complexity and dynamic of cloud environments make traditional security measures less effective, so the trust evaluation of the cloud environment can be crucial for specific services that require a higher level of trust. 
To address these challenges, this research project proposes to implement risk assessment with game theory to develop a dynamic and adaptive trust evaluation model for virtual machines in a cloud environment. The proposed model will simulate interactions between virtual machines and cloud administrators, effectively capturing the evolving nature of threats and providing a more robust mechanism for identifying and managing malicious behaviors, thereby enhancing cloud environments' overall trustworthiness and security.
